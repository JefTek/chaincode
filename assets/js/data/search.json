    "content": "As part of the Microsoft Security Customer Experience Engineering (CxE) team, part of my role is to help customers learn more about the capabilities they already have, and how to deploy them.   This can be a mix of different levels of experience and where they may be on their goals, but it is common that there is always more they would like to learn about Microsoft Entra even if they have been using Azure Active Directory for years.However,  what if you were just starting out and wanted to learn more about Microsoft Entra?   Where would you start?I was working as a mentor with someone and in helping them they asked for some recommendations on how to learn more, and how to setup a lab environment so they can get more hands on with the concepts they would be learning about.   I said I would put together a list to share, and since I think others may benefit I decided to post it here for others to discover and share.  I’m always looking for ways to share information and help others learn more, so I thought this would be useful.Please feel free to take a look at Learn Microsoft Entra where I put a summary of resources to help people of any experience level, from just starting out to experts learn more about the capabilities and how to deploy them.  Microsoft Learn learning paths to get started on the key topics  Microsoft certifictions so you can learn and also demonstrate your knowledge  Free Workshops that focus on key topics such as application developmenent for devs and admins, as well as migrating from AD FS to Azure AD  My recommendations on Youttube videos and channels to help you learn more about the features that exist today and how you can use them!If there are other items you’d like to see added please post a comment on this page below!Let me know if you find this helpful and be sure to share it with others so they can learn more and improve their skills in cloud identity.  I’ll update the page as things evolve at cloud speed, so be sure to check back often.Go to Learn Microsoft Entra"

    "content": "I wanted to highlight a new Preview feature in Entra: Report Suspicious Activity can elevate User Risk!When you enable this feature, if an end user chooses to report fraud/suspicious activity during an MFA prompt, you can raise their user risk so you can take additional actions for the user.But more importantly,  it allows organizations to use risk based CA policies to allow the appropriate user to self mitigate using Risked Based CA policies.    The appropriate users can self-mitigate without having to call the helpdesk.I’ll put links to the docs below, but let me explain more here.I have worked with many customers who blocked users who reported fraud from MFA prompts, but this causes a burden on the SOC to review and unblock them, and also a burden on the user for doing the right thing in reporting it.This could be blocking the user and having the SOC review to unblock them, but that is a BIG impact to the end user.    If a user chooses to report it, they get penalized since now they have to contact the support desk so they can get back to work.This disincentives users from doing it a 2nd time once they have that experience.Now you can use that end user signal to elevate the users risk,  much like “There is something abnormal happening!” and use the CA policies to block risk elevated users unless they can satisfy the CA policy controls.Help your users become allies so they want to report the suspicious activity to block the attackers and not themselves.This feature combined with the recent release of code match,  and context not only gives end users better tools to make decisions for MFA prompts, but also a feed back mechanism to report suspicious activity.Good security controls should help mitigate the attackers, and try to stay out of the way of the business user themselves from doing their role.   We should keep this in mind when deploying security controls, as that the user experience matters.❓Have you enabled this preview yet?❓Have you deployed Risk Based CA policies to allow users to self-mitigate elevated risk?Please like and share this since I think this one of those things many might not be aware of.  This was originally posted on Twitter but I wanted to capture it here for awareness.Learn More:  Blog: Report suspicious activity (Preview)  MS Docs : Report Suspicious Activity  MS Docs : Conditional Access templates (Preview)  MS Docs : Common Conditional Access policy: User risk-based password change"
